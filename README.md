# Guitar Haro!

This started as my assignment for FIT2102 Programming Paradigms, for which I received 29 out of the 30 marks possible and an overall grade of 93. 

My aim with this project is to upgrade the UI into something a bit more modern and create some animations, possibly even converting this project to React!
